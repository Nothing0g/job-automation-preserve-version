Use this structure only where source material supports it: # CANDIDATE NAME, a plain contact line, ## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, ## EDUCATION, ## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, ## PROJECTS, ## SKILLS, ## CERTIFICATIONS, and ## ACHIEVEMENTS & EXTRA-CURRICULARS. Use ### for a role or project title and ordinary paragraphs for the corresponding organization, location, and dates only when present in the candidate source. Keep the summary to one sentence; keep the entire resume under approximately 620 words; select the most relevant, explicitly supported items; and limit each included role or project to three or four compact bullets. Favor stronger ordering and exact rephrasing over additional claims. Do not invent a name, contact details, employer, project, metric, date, or section. Do not add code fences, horizontal dividers, a cover letter, explanation, commentary, skills not directly stated, or any text outside the resume.`,
